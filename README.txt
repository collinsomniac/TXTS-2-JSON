# README.md - TXTS-2-JSON

## Description
This Python application automates the conversion of various document formats (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT) to JSON format.
TXTS-2-JSON utilizes existing document-based libraries (python-docx, PyPDF2, textract) to create a simple PyQt5 GUI with upload and download features.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

## Backups
CAUTION: "Save Edits" buttons will currently overwrite the .docx file or .json file within this directory!
Due to the nature of the "Save Edits" buttons, creating backups for your documents is highly recommended!

# Usage
1. Launch the application via "txts-2-json.py"
2. Select input files using the "Browse" button.
3. Click the "Format Files" button to convert files to JSON.
(It will output to same directory with new .json extension.)
4. If desired, you can edit the DOCX or JSON content in the provided text area.
5. If desired, save any manual changes using the "Save Edits" buttons.
